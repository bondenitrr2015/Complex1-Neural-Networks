# Complex1-Neural-Networks

These are a set of bit more complicated neural networks than in the previous repository https://github.com/bondenitrr2015/Machine-Learning 

Here I have first tried to make a dropout based neiral network on the diabetes.csv where we have to predict weather the given person has diabetes. The fully connected layer was able to achieve 74.77% accuracy, whereas the dropout was able to predict with 79.61% accuracy. Though this is not a very good accuracy, the default one without any pre-processing was only getting 61.22% accuracy.

More Such neural networks using more complicated architectures to achieve higher accuracy will be coming soon.
